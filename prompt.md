## DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING. Whatever you write in code, it must be found in the context. Otherwise leave comments.

    ## Goal
    Help me write playwright code with following functionalities:
    - [[add semi-high level functionality you want here]]
    - [[more]]
    - [[more]]
    - [[more]]

    ## Reference
    - Use @x, @y files if you want to take reference on how I write POM code

    ## Steps
    - First fetch the context from `get-context` tool, until it returns no elements remaining
    - Based on context and user functionality, write code in POM format, encapsulating high level functionality into reusable functions
    - Try executing code using `execute-code` tool. You could be on any page, so make sure to navigate to the correct page
    - Write spec file using those reusable functions, covering multiple scenarios
